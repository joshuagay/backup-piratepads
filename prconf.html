<body><b><u>Where should have we have the presenters present?</u></b><br
/><br
/>Raffi asks, what's the best way to figure this out? Is it based on where the best audience is, or where the best commentator is?<br
/><br
/>And how do we figure out who the best commentator is?<br
/>&nbsp;First-comers.<br
/><br
/><b>Chaz Firestone, "Visual paternalism" (25)</b><br
/>Tim: Rutgers. some of the Princeton folk were not blown away by 25, but some of the Rutgers folk loved that paper<br
/><ul><li>Raffi: How many opinions are you counting? How about we email 2-3 phil of mind students at Pton and Rutgers each and ask them for a quick pulse of how interested they are in this? I'll ask Mark, Corey and Cecilia to skim the Firestone and lmk what they think.<br/><br
/></li></ul
><b>Yu Izami, "On Descriptions in Article-less Languages" (17)</b><br
/>Tim: Rutgers. Our linguisticy people will eat that one up, and we might already have a commentator for it.<br
/>Raffi: Might anyone from Princeton be able to do this?<br
/>I might be able to offer comments, but I won't take it out of someone else's hands.<br
/><br
/><b>Andrea Onofri, "Against Non-Pragmatic Russellianism" (15)</b><br
/>Tim: Princeton since it follows the Graff/Harman seminar.<br
/><br
/><b>Justin Dallman, "Moral Agency: A Frankfurtian Account" (43)</b><br
/>Tim: Princeton.<br
/><br
/><b>Rima Basu, Tracking Commitments: Revisiting the Frege-Geach Problem (38)</b><br
/>Tim: Rutgers. One of the Rutgers grads really really wants to be the commentator for Rima/38 and I think we should oblige him. But IF that means that Rima/38 has to be presented at Rutgers, then we'll have to move Kelly/21 over to Princeton.<br
/><br
/><b>Kelly Vincent, Backwards Explanation (21)</b><br
/>Tim: Princeton if Rima/38 is at Rutgers. That would be fine, I suppose. I originally thought it might be better to have Kelly/21 at Rutgers because the speaker might prefer to give her talk in the presence of Jonathan Schaffer. But if the speaker is at all interested in the topic of her own paper, I assume she'll want to come to the second day of the conference to meet Schaffer anyway. I don't know what to do here. Would it be possible to have 38 at Princeton but have the commentator for that paper be a student from Rutgers? In exchange, we could have a student from Princeton be the commentator for 21 here at Rutgers. So far, no one from Rutgers has expressed interest in being the commentator for this paper, but I'm sure that someone from the grounding seminar at Princeton would volunteer for this job. Commentator exchange goes against tradition, but I don't think the reasons underlying this tradition are very good. If we do the commentator exchange (which would be interesting) we would have 38, 43 and 15 at Princeton and 25, 17, and 21 at Rutgers.<br
/>Raffi: If Tobias says no and there are no strong reasons to go either way, maybe we should ask Kelly whether she has a preference for Rutgers over Princeton? She might, say, prefer *not* to talk in front of Schaffer for some reason, I don't know.<br
/>Thomas: Tim, have you already asked Tobias re Kelly's paper? His dissertation is on grounding. If not I'll ask him tonight. The commentator exchange seems like a good idea to me - it might increase attendance.&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh respect to that, I love hearing Tobias talk about grounding.--RKL<br
/>No I didn't ask Tobias. Okay, Thanks! I agree. Good point. Okay great!!!! Tobias sounds like a good choice.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><b><u>Questions from presenters</u></b><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelly has asked me when the conference will begin on Saturday and end on Sunday (for her/his travel plans). I assume it would start on Saturday around 10:00am and finish on Sunday around 4:00 right?<br
/>And do we provide lodging on Friday night?<br
/><br
/>Justin from USC asks (feb 17):<br
/>1) Will I be able to secure accommodations (i.e. billet with another graduate student)?<br
/>2) Is it possible to obtain funds to defray travel costs?<br
/>-rkl<br
/>Re: (2) Not from Princeton - I tried for this last year and no dice.<br
/><br
/><b><u>Archives</u></b><br
/><br
/>Should we ask the presenters what their preferences are?<br
/>This seems inefficient to me.&lt;-Ashley<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair enough. -rkl<br
/><br
/>On the matter of informing the winners and losers (of the Princeton-Rutgers conference sweepstakes) - I checked the accounts and everyone received an email.&nbsp;<br
/>Hooray! -rkl<br
